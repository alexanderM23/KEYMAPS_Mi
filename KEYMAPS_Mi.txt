Musi-(c)shy shortcut system free energy rule diagram. (by Aleksandr Mamajevs, aleksandr2@posteo.ie)
To see all diagram better, just zoom out the text (make it a bit smaller).

This is the addition to my first 'TAB' (Autohotkey Tan-Tadi-Taz-TaLa) script.
This diagram should improve a little bit the work of anybody with the keyboard's keys.
Do (Q): is good for work with closest numbers and all F1 - F6,
when Mi (M): is good for if your hand is busy with a pencil.
Note:
The keyboard's Keys names to Music Keys names transformation (Just those, I've mentioned) would improve the process of remembering of many key combinations.
